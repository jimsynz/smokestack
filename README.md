Smokestack provides a way to define test factories for your [Ash Resources](https://ash-hq.org/docs/module/ash/latest/ash-resource) using a convenient DSL:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Factory do
  use Smokestack

  factory Character do
    attribute :name, &Faker.StarWars.character/0
    attribute :affiliation, choose(["Galactic Empire", "Rebel Alliance"])
  end

  factory Character, :trek do
    attribute :name, choose(["J.L. Pipes", "Severn", "Slickback"])
    attribute :affiliation, choose(["Entrepreneur", "Voyager"])
  end
end

defmodule MyApp.CharacterTest do
  use MyApp.DataCase
  use MyApp.Factory

  test "it can build a character" do
    assert character = insert!(Character)
  end
end
```

## Installation

Smokestack is available on [Hex](https://hex.pm/packages/smokestack) you can
